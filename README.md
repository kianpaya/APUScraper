## 📌 Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core language for scripting and automation.  
- **BeautifulSoup** – HTML parsing and structured content extraction.  
- **wget** – Recursive website downloading for offline preservation.  
- **Requests** – Fetching web pages dynamically.  
- **Pandas** – Storing and analyzing extracted data.  

## ⚠ Limitations & Challenges  

⚠ **Dynamic Content Handling** – JavaScript-heavy pages may require Selenium.  
⚠ **Rate Limiting** – Some sites block frequent requests; use delays when needed.  
⚠ **Legal Considerations** – Always check the website’s `robots.txt` and scraping policies.  


## 🔮 Future Plans  

🚀 **Expand Support for JavaScript-based Sites** – Integrate Selenium or Scrapy for better scraping of dynamic pages.  
🚀 **Automated Scheduling** – Implement cron jobs for recurring scraping tasks.  
🚀 **AI-Powered Content Analysis** – Apply NLP techniques to categorize educational materials.
